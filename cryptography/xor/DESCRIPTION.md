Strangely enough, we'll start our crypto journey with the humble [Exclusive Or](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) (XOR) operator.
An XOR is one of the most common [bitwise operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation) that you will encounter in your security journey, _especially_ in cryptography.
A couple of terms to unpack here...

**Bitwise:**
Remember from [Dealing with Data](/fundamentals/data-dealings/) that computers think in binary!
That is, they conceptualize numbers in [base 2](https://www.google.com/search?q=learn+number+bases), so something like `9` is expressed as `1001`.
An XOR operates on one pair of bits at a time, producing `1` when an odd number of inputs are `1`, and `0` otherwise.

For example:
```
    1 0 0 1 (decimal 9)
XOR
    0 1 0 1 (decimal 5)
    ---------
    1 1 0 0 (decimal 12)
```

**Cryptography:**
Why is XOR so common in crypto?
In cryptography, it is common because it is [_self-inverse_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or#Properties)!
That is (using `^` for XOR here, which is consistent with many programming languages), `5 ^ 9 == 12`, and `12 ^ 9 == 5`.
If the number `9` is a key only known to you and me, I can send you messages by XORing them with `9`, and you can recover the message with XORing them with `9` as well!
Obviously, we can achieve this property with me adding 9 and you subtracting 9, without using XOR, but this requires more complex circuitry and extra bits (e.g., to handle "carrying the 1" in `1111 + 0001 == 10000`), whereas XOR does not have this problem (`1111 ^ 0001 == 1110`).

In this level, you will learn to XOR!
We'll give you a shared _key_, `XOR` a secret number with it, and expect you to recover the number.

**HINT:** Use Python's `^` operator to XOR integers and hexadecimal numbers!
